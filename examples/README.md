Examples
========

A series of examples for learning how to use the RPCircuits package. Particularly, this directory has examples that teaches:

* Basics: the basics of building/learning PCs with RPCircuits
* GMMs: an example applied to learning Gaussian Mixture Models
* Overparameterization: a seris of experiments based on the article "[Optimisation of Overparametrized Sum-Product Networks][Trapp]" of Trapp, Peharz and Pernkopf.
* Regularization: PC regularization experiments based on the article "[Tractable Regularization of Probabilistic Circuits][Liu]" of Liu and Van den Broeck.
